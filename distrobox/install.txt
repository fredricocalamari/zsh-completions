Quick Guide: Installing Zsh Completion Files

1. Place completion files in one of these locations:
- /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/
- /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/
- ~/.zsh/completion/

2. Ensure Zsh loads and uses completions:
- Add to ~/.zshrc: autoload -U compinit && compinit

3. To use a custom directory (e.g., ~/my_custom_completions) to store completion files:
- Add to ~/.zshrc above "autoload -U compinit && compinit": fpath=(~/my_custom_completions $fpath)

4. Apply changes:
- Run: source ~/.zshrc or restart terminal

Note: Check your completion files are chmod 644
